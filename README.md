# JJ View

**JJ View** brings the power of [Jujutsu (jj)](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj) version control directly into VS Code. Visualize your revision graph, manage changes, and streamline your workflow without leaving the editor.

## Features

### 🌲 Interactive Revision Graph
Visualize your `jj` repo history with a clear, interactive graph.
- **View History**: See commits, branches, and the working copy in a topological view.
- **Inspect Changes**: Click on any node to view details and diffs.
- **Context Actions**: Right-click nodes to perform actions like editing, squashing, or abandoning changes.
- **Drag & Drop Workflows**:
  - **Rebase Source**: Drag a commit onto another to rebase it (and its children) onto the target.
  - **Rebase Revision**: Hold `Ctrl` (or `⌘` on macOS) while dragging to rebase only the specific revision.
  - **Move Bookmarks**: Drag bookmark pills from one commit to another to move them.
- **Selection**:
  - **Multi-Select**: `Ctrl+Click` (or `⌘+Click`) to select multiple commits.
  - **Contextual Commands**: Perform bulk actions like "Abandon" on all selected commits.
  - **Clear**: Press `Escape` to clear the selection.



### 📝 Commit Details Panel
A dedicated view for inspecting and managing commits.
- **Edit Descriptions**: Easily update commit messages.
- **File Differences**: View list of changed files and open diffs side-by-side.
- **Navigation**: Click changes to look at them in standard VS Code diff editors.

### 🛠️ Source Control Integration
Full integration with VS Code's Source Control view (SCM).
- **Working Copy**: View modified files, stage changes (via `jj` commit/squash workflows), and restore files.
- **Commit Management**: Create new changes, set descriptions, and squash changes directly from the SCM panel.
- **Merge Conflicts**: Identify and resolve conflicts using VS Code's merge editor.
- **File Decorations**: Automatically highlights modified, added, and conflicted files in the Explorer with color-coded badges.
